## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have just started with learning web development and I learned a lot of stuff by completing this project. But there are some things I thought were not possible before are:
- Adding a different color to a background image

```html
<section id="display-image">
  <div id="image-overlay"></div>
</section> 
```

```css
#display-image {
    background-image: url('images/image-header-desktop.jpg');
    background-size: 100% 100%;
}

#image-overlay {
    background-color: rgba(205, 30, 210, 0.5);
}

```

### Continued development

There are a lot of things that I would like to refine but the main areas that I would focus on would be:
- Flexbox
- Creating responsive images

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox: CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - The pictorial representation of the different properties of flexbox in this guide greatly helped in their understandings.
